# WebBox

A Xamarin Cocoa app that lets you open a specific webpage within a native Mac 
app. Useful when you don't want a hard-to-find browser tab open with your 
favorite radio stream, work calendar, etc. 

A bit like [FluidApp](https://fluidapp.com/), but currently you have to manually 
update the app icon and window title and compile it yourself. Requires Xcode and 
Visual Studio (Community or better) for Mac.

Written in C#. Why? 'Cause. Fight me.
